### Data Types
#### Primitive Data Types :<br/>
number: Numeric values, both integer and floating-point ```let age = 25;// Integer ``` ```let price = 19.99;  // Floating-point```<br/>
string: Sequence of characters ```let name = "John";```<br/>
boolean: True or false values ```let isActive = true;```<br/>
#### Reference Data Types<br/>
Arrays: A collection of elements, all of the same or different types. Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size.```let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];``` ``` let names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]; ```.<br/>
Objects: A collection of key-value pairs. ```let person = { name: "John", age: 30 }; ```<br/>
